# ATM-and-Bank-Account-managment-System-Using-OOps-concept
In this Project we have desgined and processed an ATM management system using basic OOP's concept.
Bank.py is the main file where a class called Bank_accnt is created, which it has a function to get basic details of account holder.
We have used the Basic.py file and used or inheritted the class from the file to interface file.
In interface file where all management operations and functions were given and also we can access the Bank account through mobile number also.
By using mobile number we get the basic information of customer.
